1
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:15,713
Shah Rukh Khan: "A girl should be seen, not heard."

2
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:17,463
"Be quiet," or, "chup."

3
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:21,171
These words are often used to silence girls right from childhood,

4
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:22,504
well into adulthood

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,254
and deep into old age.

6
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:27,921
I'm proud to introduce our next speaker, a true champion of the female voice,

7
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,588
an advisor on poverty,

8
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,754
gender and development for the World Bank,

9
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:36,088
United Nations and several NGOs in India and the world over.

10
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:39,629
She calls herself a cultural detective.

11
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:44,296
Let's raise our voices to welcome renowned social scientist and author

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,921
Deepa Narayan.

13
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,171
(Music)

14
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:52,112
(Applause)

15
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:58,713
Deepa Narayan: The goal of every loving parent

16
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:00,588
is to raise good girls,

17
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:02,421
but what parents actually do

18
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:06,963
is to constrain, confine and crush their girls.

19
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:08,838
So as they crush their girls,

20
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:10,778
they prepare them for abuse.

21
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:13,879
This would be so devastating

22
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:16,463
that no parent would be able to bear it,

23
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:17,754
so it's disguised.

24
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:21,046
In India, we call this "adjusting."

25
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,612
I'm sure you've heard the word.

26
00:01:23,445 --> 00:01:25,504
"Darling, just adjust a bit.

27
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:26,796
Just adjust.

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,796
No matter what happens, just adjust."

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,629
"Adjust" trains girls to be powerless,

30
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:36,213
not to exist, not to be seen,

31
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:37,921
not to have a self,

32
00:01:37,945 --> 00:01:44,338
and it trains boys to claim power and authority over the world.

33
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:49,838
And in the meantime we keep talking about gender equality and women's empowerment.

34
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:55,463
After 2012, after the gang rape in a moving bus in Delhi,

35
00:01:55,487 --> 00:02:00,504
I really wanted to understand the roots of abuse.

36
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:03,963
So I started asking a very simple question:

37
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:09,278
what does it mean to you to be a good woman or a good man today?

38
00:02:10,153 --> 00:02:13,046
And I was so surprised by what I heard,

39
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,421
the answers particularly that young people gave,

40
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:22,004
that the project became a research project and it took over my life.

41
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:27,463
For three years, I listened to over 600 women, men and children,

42
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,296
educated, middle class,

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,379
and it led to 1,800 hours of listening

44
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,713
and 8,000 pages of notes,

45
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:38,171
and it took another year to make sense of it.

46
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:44,254
Nowadays, we see well-dressed, educated women like many of you in this room,

47
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:47,088
all of you in this room, and myself,

48
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:49,671
and we think the world has changed,

49
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:53,504
but these external changes are extremely misleading,

50
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:56,487
because on the inside, we have not changed.

51
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:00,629
So today, I'm not going to talk about poor people.

52
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:03,588
I'm going to talk only about the middle and upper classes,

53
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:06,713
because we are the ones most in denial.

54
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:10,838
We are the ones who have said over and over again

55
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:13,004
that when women are educated,

56
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:14,379
when they're employed

57
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,713
and they earn incomes,

58
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:19,445
they will be equal, empowered and free.

59
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:21,879
They're not.

60
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:23,171
Why?

61
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:26,838
From my research, I identify seven habits

62
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:28,421
that delete women,

63
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:30,629
that make women disappear,

64
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:33,254
but these habits persist

65
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:35,671
because they're so familiar to us

66
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:37,778
and we've made them good and moral.

67
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:42,195
Why would you change or drop anything that's good and moral?

68
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,379
So, on the one hand, we love our children,

69
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:46,713
we love our daughters,

70
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:49,112
and on the other hand, we crush them.

71
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:53,445
Habit one: You don't have a body.

72
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,338
The first step to make a girl a ghost is to make her body disappear,

73
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:02,588
to pretend that she doesn't have a body.

74
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:05,463
Akangsha, who is 23, said,

75
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:09,838
"In my family, we never spoke about the body, never."

76
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:11,463
And it is in this silence

77
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:15,379
that millions and millions of girls get sexually molested,

78
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:18,570
and they don't even tell their mothers.

79
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:21,921
And it's the negative comments from others

80
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:26,653
that leads to 90 percent of women saying that they dislike their bodies.

81
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:29,546
When a girl rejects her body,

82
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,629
she rejects her only house

83
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:34,546
and invisibility and insecurity

84
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,213
become her very shaky foundation.

85
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:40,820
Habit two: Be quiet. Chup.

86
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:43,379
If you're not supposed to exist

87
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:45,004
and you don't have a body,

88
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:47,171
how can you have a voice?

89
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:49,088
So just about every woman said,

90
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:53,254
"When I was little, my mother used to scold me and say,

91
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:56,254
'Don't speak, be quiet, be chup,

92
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:59,796
speak softly, don't argue and never answer back.

93
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,129
Jawab nahi Dena.'"

94
00:05:01,153 --> 00:05:02,695
I'm sure you've all heard that.

95
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,046
And so girls become afraid, and they withdraw.

96
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,463
And they become quiet and they say,

97
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:11,296
"Let it go. Jaane do.

98
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,153
What's the point? Nobody listens."

99
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:16,004
Educated women said

100
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:17,588
that their number one problem

101
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:20,879
was their inability to speak up,

102
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,796
as if there was a foot on their throat

103
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,070
ready to choke them.

104
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,028
Silence slices off women.

105
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:34,088
Habit three: Be a people pleaser.

106
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:35,379
Please others.

107
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:38,546
Everyone likes a nice woman who always smiles,

108
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,004
who never says no, who is never angry,

109
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:43,088
even when she's being exploited.

110
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:45,838
Amisha, who is 18, said,

111
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,129
"My father said,

112
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:51,153
'If I don't see you smiling, I don't feel good.'"

113
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:53,296
So she smiles.

114
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,879
So her father is teaching her,

115
00:05:55,903 --> 00:05:59,838
my happiness is more important than your happiness.

116
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:04,088
And in this business of trying to make everyone happy all the time,

117
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,987
girls become afraid to make decisions.

118
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:10,463
And when you ask them, they say,

119
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,862
"Anything, whatever! Kuch bhi!

120
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:15,528
Everything goes. Chalta hai."

121
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:18,921
Darsha, who is 25,

122
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,838
said with great pride,

123
00:06:20,862 --> 00:06:23,338
"I'm highly elastic.

124
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:26,612
I become whatever others want me to be."

125
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,046
Such girls give up their dreams,

126
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,379
their desires,

127
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:33,338
and nobody even notices,

128
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:35,296
except for depression.

129
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,570
It moves in.

130
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:40,820
Another slice of a girl is taken off.

131
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:45,570
Habit four: You have no sexuality.

132
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,921
I think you'd all agree that with a population of over 1.3 billion,

133
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,820
sex is not new to India.

134
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:58,754
What is new is that more people now acknowledge

135
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:01,820
that women, too, have a right to sexual desire.

136
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:06,338
But how can a woman who has not been allowed to own her body,

137
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:08,796
who hasn't been educated about her body,

138
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,296
who may have been sexually molested,

139
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,796
who cannot say no

140
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,004
and who has been filled with shame,

141
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:17,403
how can she claim her sexual desire?

142
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,862
A woman's sexuality is suppressed.

143
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:25,737
Habit five: Don't trust women.

144
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:29,254
Imagine how the world would change

145
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:31,754
if women came together in solidarity,

146
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:34,588
but as to make sure that this doesn't happen,

147
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:38,088
our culture places high moral value

148
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:41,403
on loyalty to men and family secrecy.

149
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,588
Woman after woman said,

150
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:46,213
"I know only one trustworthy woman,

151
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:47,838
and that's me."

152
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:49,379
Even Ruchi, who is 30

153
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:53,296
and who works on women's empowerment at Delhi University, said,

154
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,213
"I don't trust women. They're jealous and they backbite."

155
00:07:57,237 --> 00:07:59,004
Obviously, then, in cities,

156
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,879
women don't join women's groups,

157
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:04,153
and when you ask them why, they say, "We don't have time for gossip."

158
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:08,945
It's much easier  to demolish a woman who is alone.

159
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:13,737
Habit six: Duty over desire.

160
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:18,963
Muskan gave a very long definition of a good girl, and she's only 15.

161
00:08:18,987 --> 00:08:21,588
"She is kind, gentle, polite, loving,

162
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:24,046
caring, truthful, obedient, respects elders,

163
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,737
helps everyone unconditionally, and is good to others and fulfills duty."

164
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:31,379
Tiring, isn't it.

165
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:34,338
By the time you fulfill duty,

166
00:08:34,362 --> 00:08:37,796
whatever little desire is left is also lost.

167
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,338
And when sacrificing mothers have nothing left to say

168
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:43,046
except talk about food --

169
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,004
"Have you eaten? Khana kha liya? What will you eat?" --

170
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:51,112
men like Saurabh, who is 24, call them "boring."

171
00:08:52,237 --> 00:08:54,796
A woman becomes a residue.

172
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,004
Habit seven: Be totally dependent.

173
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:02,129
So all these habits collectively crush women,

174
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:03,671
fill her with fear

175
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:07,296
and make her totally dependent on men for her survival,

176
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,987
and this allows the system of male power to continue.

177
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:16,421
So all these seven habits that we thought were good and moral

178
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:19,338
snatch life away from girls

179
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:21,778
and position men to abuse.

180
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,796
We must change.

181
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,070
How do we change?

182
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:28,737
A habit is just a habit.

183
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,921
Every habit is a learned habit,

184
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:33,504
so we can unlearn them

185
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:36,213
and this personal change is extremely important.

186
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:38,338
I had to change too.

187
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:40,921
But this doesn't change the system

188
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:43,237
that crushes millions of other women.

189
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:46,213
So we have to go to the roots.

190
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:50,629
We must change what it means to be a good woman and a good man,

191
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:53,403
because this a foundation of every society.

192
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:58,504
We don't need elastic women, we need elastic definitions,

193
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:00,088
for men too,

194
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:05,338
and this big societal change cannot happen without men's involvement.

195
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:06,629
We need you.

196
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:09,671
We need men to become champions of change,

197
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:12,879
to develop strong change muscles.

198
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,421
Otherwise, it will be two more centuries

199
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:17,796
before our girls, and our boys,

200
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,070
are safe and free.

201
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:26,379
Imagine half a billion women coming together, with the support of men,

202
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:29,504
to talk to one another for conversation, for change,

203
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,421
both personal and political,

204
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:33,796
and imagine men in their own circles,

205
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,088
and imagine women and men coming together to just listen to each other

206
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:40,504
without judgment, without blame,

207
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:43,338
without accusations and without shame.

208
00:10:43,362 --> 00:10:45,421
Imagine how much we would change.

209
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,338
We can do this together.

210
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:49,778
Women, don't adjust.

211
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:52,903
Men, adjust.

212
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,546
It's time.

213
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,921
Thank you.

214
00:10:56,945 --> 00:11:00,778
(Applause)

215
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:02,995
SRK: How well said, how wonderful.

216
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,757
Everyone, Deepa, please.

217
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,629
Listening to her, I realized

218
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:10,213
that even in the simplest conversations that we have with women,

219
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,796
we're actually being aggressive.

220
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,713
For example, I do tell my daughter sometimes,

221
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:17,879
"Yaar Tu hasti hai to mujhe accha lagta hai varna bura lagta hai".

222
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:19,504
So sorry, I would never do that.

223
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,588
Aaj Se main meri beti ko yahi bolunga.

224
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:22,921
Whatever you're doing,

225
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:25,546
mujhe accha hi lagta hai, aur accha nahi bhi lagta hai

226
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,421
Toh mera kya, tum wohi karo jo tumhare ko lagta hai, right?

227
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:31,338
(Applause)

228
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:32,838
How did you feel,

229
00:11:32,862 --> 00:11:38,796
first listening to so many unfulfilled stories, desires,

230
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,129
lack of independence,

231
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:44,671
of girls that you normally would assume we think these girls are better off?

232
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:46,201
DN: Very depressed.

233
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:49,088
It was shocking for me, and that's why I couldn't stop,

234
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:53,088
because I had no plans to do a study and no plans to write a book.

235
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,921
I'd written 17 books before, and I thought, "I'm done,"

236
00:11:56,945 --> 00:11:59,088
but when I went to St. Stephen's College

237
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:04,213
and I heard, at most elite colleges you well know from Delhi,

238
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:06,296
and the young women and the men,

239
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,171
what they said about what it meant to them to be a woman and man

240
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:13,463
sounded not like me but like my mother's generation.

241
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:16,588
So then I went to another college and another college.

242
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,296
The thing that was striking to me

243
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,754
is that each woman felt she was alone,

244
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:25,171
that she hides her fear and hides her behavior,

245
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:27,195
because she thinks it's a personal fault.

246
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:30,879
It's not a personal fault, it's training,

247
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:33,213
and I think that's the biggest revelation

248
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:36,671
is that, if we stop pretending,

249
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:38,421
then the world changes.

250
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:41,129
SRK: Do you girls all agree with what Deepa is saying?

251
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:44,004
(Applause)

252
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,754
Already see that young girl saying,

253
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:48,379
"Heard, heard what she said? You say this to me."

254
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:50,088
Yeah, that's the way it should be.

255
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:52,838
You, boy, you adjust. We are not adjusting anymore, OK?

256
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:54,421
(Applause)

257
00:12:54,445 --> 00:12:56,796
Thank you so much. Have a good evening. Thank you.

258
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,970
(Applause)
